Hi, I am Endale Teshome from Ethiopia, and working in a government organization of rural land administration on a position as a land use planning GIS expert for almost eight years. - 
- 👀 I’m interested in the GitHub interface to join and share my experience and knowledge in GIS data collection, organizing, managing, and disseminating information for its respective purpose. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the MSc at Assosa University with a specialization in sustainable natural resource and environmental management.
- At this time I will cover all the necessary courses and be ready to do the remaining thesis.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on GIS data analysis and database management in related disciplines. 
- 📫 I prefer GitHub.com as the perfect communication site to do things further. 
- 😄 Pronouns: ...Let the Almighty God help us to achieve the plausible vision. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...A-Z letter contents:- the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!
